    "motivation": "The net worth sessions view is designed to help you analyze your earnings during your gaming session without the influence of your current net worth and its price fluctuations. Net worth sessions are completely isolated from the outside. Each profile can have one session. These sessions are isolated from each other even with the same stash tabs.",
    "initial_step": "A net worth session is similar to the normal view. However, you always start from scratch.\nAny items you add or remove to an active session are displayed.\nItems that you remove during an active session without having added them are displayed negatively.\nAny items you add or remove to an inactive session will not be added or removed.\n\nThere are four different states for this.\n<strong>Online:</strong> If you start or continue the session. The session duration timer counts up.\n<strong>Pause:</strong> If the session is active again or you pause the session.\n<strong>Offline:</strong> The time while the app is closed while the session is active.\n<strong>Inactive:</strong> If you switch to another profile.\n",

    "session_duration_history_pie_chart_step": "Here you can see a summary of your times by states.",
    "manual_adjustment_step": "Here you can manually adjust your session duration so that the income is not calculated incorrectly if you forgot to switch to pause.",
    "profile_step": "If you switch to another profile with an inactive session, the session will be paused and any items you added or removed during inactivity will be subtracted with the first snapshot taken (after 30s).",

You can zoom the x-Axis for the selection or click a marker that selects the snapshot it's based on.",
